# Battery Optimization with Dynamic Leader Node Selection

This repository contains the project report, code, and resources for **"Battery Optimization with Dynamic Leader Node Selection,"** a project focused on enhancing the energy efficiency and longevity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in disaster-prone environments.

---

## üìã Brief Summary and Purpose

In resource-constrained environments such as disaster recovery zones, maintaining uninterrupted communication is critical. This project addresses the challenge of limited battery life in temporary wireless sensor nodes deployed during such events.  
**The core purpose:** Propose and validate an innovative, energy-efficient protocol that significantly extends the operational lifespan of deployed nodes. By optimizing energy consumption, this protocol ensures resilient and reliable communication, which is vital for effective disaster response, real-time monitoring, and efficient resource allocation.

## ‚ú® Key Features and Modules

- **Dynamic Leader Node Selection:**  
  The node with the highest battery capacity is dynamically chosen as the leader to handle data transmission. This process occurs at regular intervals to prevent rapid depletion of any single node. Non-leader nodes remain in low-power sleep mode to conserve energy.

- **Modified Wake-Up Radio Concept:**  
  Enhances energy efficiency by dynamically managing node activity cycles, allowing non-essential nodes to remain in sleep mode until needed.

- **Intelligent Cluster Head Switching:**  
  Selects cluster head nodes based on sufficient battery life, distributing energy load more evenly and supporting network longevity.

- **Multi-Platform Simulation:**  
  - **MATLAB Simulation:** In-depth analysis of energy conservation, leader rotation, and realistic network behavior, with real-time visualization.
  - **Web Application (React):** Real-time, interactive display of network activity, including node statuses, battery levels, and leader identification.
  - **Android Application:** Real-time data exchange and status updates using mobile device functionality and WebSocket communication, including automated data generation (e.g., random earthquake data).

- **WebSocket Communication:**  
  Utilized in both web and Android applications for real-time, bidirectional event-based communication, ensuring dynamic updates and interactive experiences.
